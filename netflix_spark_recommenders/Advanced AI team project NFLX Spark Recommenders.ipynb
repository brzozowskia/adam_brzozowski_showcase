Adam had used this extensively during his time doing consumer market research related work and wanted to show this application of a very infrequently used and underrated algorithm. Specifically, it was Adam's intention to demonstrate that traditional recommenders can't perform the kind of spear fishing that consumers need to make an actual leap they wouldn't have made otherwise. \n","\n","While there's undoubtedly a lot to unpack on this topic, at the very least we hope you will take away from this demo that market basket analysis can be used to make recommendations and how to do it as another way to generate *novel* insights and recommendations when faced with a given data set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bvZS2CFLh_B9"},"source":["## Data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"55IrCrFAvJYS"},"source":["This demo uses the data set available at\n","https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data?select=README\n","\n","The data comprised four movie files of 200 mb each:\n","\n","(1) combined_data_1.txt\n","\n","(2) combined_data_2.txt\n","\n","(3) combined_data_3.txt\n","\n","(4) combined_data_4.txt\n","\n","In addition, a reference data file was provided with the name of the movies.

The first column would be the user ID and the second column would be a list of movies selected.\n","\n","In our example, the movies selected happen to be on a ratings scale. With a priori, the way to think about this is the original motivation of the algorithm - which was \"market basket analysis\" of basically discrete choices to buy or not buy a product in a supermarket. \n","\n","With our ratings data, we know that some of the ratings are very high, and some are quite low , and some are basically totally neutral. A reasonable transformation of the data would be to try to evaluate to recommendations based on high ratings only. So given that a user scores a movie a 4 or 5, encoding the data as having been selected. \n","\n","Frankly, I know that it's common practice to do a recommender system to predict how someone would rate something, but there's limited value in figuring out what we should NOT present to a user. We want to know what we should recommend - so let's just do that.\n","\n","The most expedient way to do this is to employ a select statement to remove all of the ratings that are less than 3. Then, we can simply run a grouping statement to roll up all of the movie IDs that are left into a user ID as a list, thereby conforming to the requirements of the algorithm's target format. An added benefit of this treatment of the data is that it inherently eliminates large numbers of unwanted records while simultaneously giving us the capability to achieve precision recommendations based on all of the remaining titles to find a good one for that specific person.\n","\n","In industry, Adam has found this type of treatment of the data to be not only practical and expedient from a computational perspective, but also capable of identifying novel insights that other types of methodologies tend to miss. He thinks that the reason for this is the ability of the algorithm to pay attention to local distributions of data vs giving only the most likely answers - thereby leading to deeper insights from revealed preferences oriented data.\n","\n","Lastly, by comparing the set of what a user has seen to what they haven't, we can also efficiently provide recommendations that are actually new - vs only recommending movies they've already seen. Stepping back for a minute, and thinking about the problem of overfitting as well, if most modelers are working with the entire 100 million rows of recommendations , they're weighting their recommendations to 40 percent based on movies people don't actually want. With each movie being a feature, that could be a massive overfitting problem."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8qCtNAkuUsha"},"outputs":[],"source":["#https://www.educba.com/pyspark-filter/\n","#a.filter(a.Name ==

At 100 million rows, the usual in memory techniques did not work. Moreover, recommendations are inherently also *high dimension* sparse matrix type problems ; that 100 million rows was really a sparse matrix of 100 million rows X 17k columns. To work with this data we learned some rudimentary spark techniques.\n","\n","Once we did get our stack to work, we very quickly began to draw insights from the entire asset instead of potentially sample level insights gained from down sampling our data. It only took a quick examination of the data to determine that Netflix's movie portfolio was not very well optimized. While the typical rating skewed neutral to favorable, the distribution of average movie ratings itself was more or less normally distributed. In general, this pointed to additional opportunity to optimize at the title level. \n","\n","The typical approaches for this data set revolve around responding to the likert scale that the data is presented on. We also did this with alternate least squares (ALS) and a neural net, but we also chose to take a somewhat different approach to the problem in which we sought to create recommendations based on favorable ratings (4-5 on the likert scale). \n","\n","Doing this led us to train recommenders using market basket analysis. Very much analagous to selecting 50 or so items in a grocery store containing perhaps 100k SKUs, a recommender trained to identify frequent favorite itemsets will capture recommendations based on a local distribution of data. To be useful, recommenders by definition should identify recommendations for a consumer that they have not seen before but which they would have a high propensity to like. In the original Netflix prize, contestants were asked (oddly) to predict all of the movie ratings for a basket of consumers. It's not that surprising that Netflix never took that system into production - why would anyone want an algorithm that's trained to be proficient at predicting ratings for consumers that they have already watched? Moreover, that approach also invests substantial effort in predicting ratings for movies that people don't even like. \n","\n","Overall, recommenders should play an important role in the consumer ecosystem. By nudging consumers in the right direction, brands can save their consumers time and effort and increase sales. However, while each recommender system can cross validate and test well on old data, the ultimate test of truth is experimentation. Netflix is famous for running experiments. While there are a lot of interesting debates about \"statistics\" vs \"data science\" right now, Netflix is a great example of where these two worlds meet. We believe the right way to think about these types of algorithms is that the techniques provide useful systematic treatment of the data at scale while statistics can be used to perform more controlled testing. Randomly sampling consumers into different groups and presenting different recommendations based on different techniques can create compelling and verifiable business value.\n","\n","\n","Netflix presenting on its technology and approach at a data science conference: \n","https://youtu.be/II8GlmbDg9M \n","\n","\n","Note as well that, broadly speaking, we must be mindful of the potential biases and limitations of recommenders--popularity bias, myopia, and the like--and the ethical ramifications of letting those biases creep into marketing and media-sharing platforms. Because of this, it is important to consider the recommenders we use carefully. Tools such as PySpark can help us try out different approaches more efficiently and effectively."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["9ENFOIT96g6B"],"machine_shape":"hm","toc_visible":true,"provenance":[]},"gpuClass":"standard","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
